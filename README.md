Asteroids

Speacial thanks to Nicolas Gramlic for writing Andengine and porting Box2D extension and Matim for writing some helpful tutorials around it.

Notes:

1.> The application runs using Andengine. So we need the Andengine and Andengine Physics Extension present in the workspace for building the app.

Features:

1.> Game starts with the Spaceship looking Downwards.

2.> The spaceship is bound to the Controller which is present on the left hand side. 

3.> There are 3 more buttons present in the screen. Shoot, Thrust and HyperSpace.

4.> Shoot button will shoot a bullet in the direction of the Spaceship's tip. 

5.> Pressing Thrust would accelerate the Spaceship. To control thrust in a direction use with the compbination of the Direction key. 

6.> The mode the direction key knowb is away from the base the the more speed the spaceship would have when thrust is pressed.

7.> Hyperspace button will move the spaceship in any random location in the screen (it might move fatal).




Todo's
-----------

1.> Wrap spaceship movements. As in if it goes out of one side of the screen it should come back form another side. 

2.> Memory optimization (work in progress)
